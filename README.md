# Bitcoin Price Prediction
In this project, firstly we are going to do some analysis of the bitcoin prices like detecting outliers, pattern and structure in the time series using ACF and PACF plots and try to extract trend, seasonality and cyclicity using seasonal decomposition.
Further on we use various machine learning models to forecast the bitcoin prices into the future and will try to evaluate the performance of each model.
In the end, we will discuss the turkey problem found while forecasting bitcoin prices using timeseries analysis.
